1. COMPILING AND RUNNING

   To compile, unpack the tarball and call make:

   $ tar xvf minns.tar.gz
   $ make

   This makes all the binaries (main executable and some unit tests)
   in ./bin. You should run minns for the first time by typing

   $ bin/minns -h

   , which gives you a list of command line options. You'll probably
   want to try minns on non-reserved UDP and TCP ports using the -t
   and -u options.

2. FEATURES

   The main features of minns are:

   a) prethreaded DNS served designed with robustness,
      simplicity, efficiency and capacity in mind. ;-)

   b) support of QUERY_A type DNS queries.

   c) reads entries of a file similar to /etc/hosts. caches frequently
      accessed entries for faster response.

   d) supports queries in both UDP and TCP transport

   e) uses no external libraries apart from libc and stdl

   d) portable at least to MacOSX 10.5 Leopard (Darwin/BSD) 
 
3. LIMITATIONS

   e) only supports IPV4 queries

   f) almost POSIX compliant, but not quite (SO_RECVTIMEO is not
      standard)

   g) the truncation (TC) bit in DNS UDP replies is not
      implemented. The server responds with a "Server failure"
      condition instead. However, a client can try a TCP request and
      will probably get a nicer answer. 

   h) the server cannot run as a daemon yet.

4. ARCHITECTURE

4.1 Overview

   minns can be seen as composed of three parts:

   a) three mini-libraries (TcpSocket, UdpSocket, Thread), independent
      between themselves, that wrap useful system calls and provide
      error handling through exceptions.

   b) a DnsResolver base class, responsible for dealing with the hosts
      file and managing the cache, also independent.

   c) the prethreaded DNS Server, that depends on the two preceding
      parts, and is composed of base classes DnsServer, DnsWorker and
      DnsMessage.

4.2 Prethreaded DNS server (DnsServer.cpp, DnsWorker.cpp, DnsMessage.cpp)

    a) DnsServer (DnsServer.cpp)

       A single instance of class DnsServer is spawns a number of
       DnsWorker threads. DnsWorker is an abstract base class to both the
       UdpWorker and TcpWorker concrete classes, which handle UDP and TCP
       requests, respectively. It owns the following objects, initialized
       in the constructor.

       1. A single UdpSocket object for datagram communication, shared
          by all UdpWorker's.
        
       2. A single TcpSocket object (server socket) shared by all
          TcpWorkers's. This socket is put in the LISTEN state.
        
       3. A variable number of UdpWorkers and TcpWorkers. On
          construction, these are given an instance of the DnsResolver
          class.
        
       4. One mutex to protect access to the DnsResolver class and
          another to protect access to the server socket.
        
       The entry point DnsServer::start() proceeds as follows:
        
       1. Install signal handlers for the SIGTERM and SIGINT signals;
        
       2. Creates worker threads using the Thread(Runnable&)
          constructor (DnsWorker objects are Thread::Runnable's);
        
       3. Runs all worker threads;
        
       4. Waits on an exit semaphore, which is signalled when SIGTERM
          or SIGINT signals are received by the process;
        
       5. Signals all workers to stop;
        
       6. Closes both UDP and TCP sockets;
        
       7. Signals possibly blocked threads with the SIGALRM signal
          (this causes any system calls to be interrupted);
        
       8. Waits for all threds to finish (calling pthread_join());
        
       9. Reports on worker status on exit;

    
    b) DnsWorker, UdpWorker, TcpWorker (DnsWorker.cpp)

       Each instance of the DnsWorker class runs in its own thread. This
       abstract class tries to abstract as much similarity as possible
       between the UDP and TCP cases.
        
       The main entry point is DnsWorker::work(). It uses the following
       pure virtual functions:
        
       virtual void setup() = 0;
        
           This method is called before trying to receive any queries
           and after each teardown() operation.
           
           TcpWorker's implementation of this method calls accept(),
           after locking a mutex, thereby producting another TcpSocket
           object used to connect to the client.
        
        	UdpWorker's implementation does nothing.
        
       virtual void teardown() = 0;
        
           This method is called when an exceptional event happens
           after setup in one of the sockets.
        
           TcpWorker's implementation of this method closes the client
           socket and deletes the TcpSocket object.
        
           UdpWorker's implementation does nothing.
        
       virtual size_t readQuery(char * buff, char * bufflen) = 0;
        
           This method is called after setup() and produce a buffer of
           data for constructing a DnsMessage object.
        
           UdpWorker's implementation of this method simply reads a
           datagram from the UdpSocket object.
        
           TcpWorker's implementation reads 2 bytes containing the
           length of the message and then reads the rest of the
           message.
        
       virtual size_t sendResponse(char* buff, char *bufflen) = 0;
        
           This method is called when DnsWorker needs to send a
           serialized response (even if an error);
        
           Again, TcpWorker's implementation of this method only
           differs from UdpWorker's in the fact that two extra bytes
           are sent representing the message length.

    
    c) DnsMessage, DnsResponse, DnsErrorResponse (DnsMessage.cpp)

       An instance of the DnsResponse class is built using a
       DnsResolver object. This object is used to resolve the actual
       name being queried, but only after locking a mutex.

       Apart from that, these classes deal mostly with parsing and
       serialization of messages. They could have been implemented
       using bitfields which would be more efficient but maybe less
       portable, so I haven't attempted it yet.

       Exceptions are also thrown from some of the operations of these
       classes. They are handled by the DnsWorker class.

4.3 DnsResolver (DnsResolver.cpp)

    This class is responsible for reading the hosts file and is always
    delegated the resolution of a domain name. A size-limited cache is
    used to speed up resolutions.

    The method "addr_set_t* resolve (const string& name)" contains the
    main algorithm and proceeds as follows:

    1. If the file has been modified since the last time it was read,
       clear the cache. (this can be turned off with the -n option for
       efficiency)

    2. Lookup the entry in the cache, if it is there return the set of
       corresponding addresses is returned.

    3. Otherwise, start searching the file from the beginning. Parse a
       complete line. For each name entry in a valid line do:

       3.1 if the name matches the search insert the <name, ip>
           mapping it into the cache.

       3.2 else, if the cache is not full, insert the into the cache
           anyway,

       3.3 else dont do anything.

    4. If a result has been found, return it, else go back to 3. and
       parse another line.
     
    The cache itself is implemented by class DnsResolver::Cache and is
    composed of the following data structures:

    a) A map (std::map), mapping names to sets of addresses; 

    b) A list (std::list) instance, keeping track of the most recently
       searches;

    and the following operations:

    addr_set_t* lookup(const string& name);

         Returns a matching set of ip addresses if these are found in
         a) or NULL otherwise.

         If a match is found in map a), the entry found also contains
         a hidden pointer to the position of the match in the list b).
         That entry in the list is moved up to the beginning of the
         list, and the pointer in map a)'s matching entry is updated.

         Implementation-wise, iterators are used instead of raw
         pointers.

    addr_set_t* insert(const string& name, struct in_addr ip);

         Inserts the <name, ip> mapping into the cache.

	 If an entry for 'name' is already ins map a) , add the ip the
	 set of ips associciated with 'name'.

         Otherwise, create a new entry in map a). Also, insert into
         the beginning of the list b) a a pointer to this
         entry. Finally, make newly create entry point to the list as
         well.

	 If after these steps the cache has exceeded its maximum size,
	 remove the last element from the list b) and the
	 corresponding map entry from map a).

4.4 TcpSocket, UdpSocket and Thread mini-libraries

    These libraries wrap POSIX system calls in nice C++ classes. They
    are not intended to be fully fleged API implementations, other
    external libraries already do that. But these do the job nicely. A
    handfull of (quickly written and possibly buggy) unit tests is
    available in ./test.
